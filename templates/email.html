    Good evening,
  </p>
  <p>
    Your dinner group for tonight is:
  </p>
  <ul>
    {{#each recipients}}
    <li>{{this}}</li>
    {{/each}}
  </ul>
  <p>
    You might consider dining at {{restaurants.[0]}} or {{restaurants.[1]}}. While you dine, perhaps you and your companions could discuss {{topics.[0]}}, or {{topics.[1]}}.  Please keep things civil, though.
  </p>
  <p>
    Always at your service,
    <br />
    Alastair J.S.
    <br />
    Your Butler
